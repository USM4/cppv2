# C++ Modules Overview

This repository contains multiple C++ modules designed to help you understand various C++ concepts. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of the C++ programming language and provides detailed explanations and examples to enhance your understanding.

## **Modules**

### **CPP Module 05: Exceptions and Try/Catch**

This module is designed to help you understand how exceptions are handled in C++. It covers the basics of `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords, as well as best practices for error handling in C++.

**Key Concepts**:
- Exception handling with `try`, `catch`, and `throw`
- Understanding exception types and their propagation
- Creating custom exceptions
- Handling multiple exceptions
- Proper cleanup using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

### **CPP Module 06: C++ Type Casting**

This module introduces the various types of casting in C++, including static, dynamic, const, and reinterpret casts. You'll learn when and how to use each type of cast properly.

**Key Concepts**:
- `static_cast`: Compile-time type conversion
- `dynamic_cast`: Runtime type conversion (used primarily with polymorphism)
- `const_cast`: Removing or adding `const` qualifier to variables
- `reinterpret_cast`: Low-level casting for different types of objects

### **CPP Module 07: Templates in C++**

This module explains C++ templates and how they allow you to write generic functions and classes. Templates are a powerful feature of C++ and enable code reusability for different data types.

**Key Concepts**:
- Function templates
- Class templates
- Template specialization
- Non-type template parameters
- Type traits and SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)

### **CPP Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms**

This module covers templated containers like `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map`, and iterators in C++. You'll also learn about algorithms from the Standard Library and how they can be used with templated containers.

**Key Concepts**:
- Templated containers in the C++ Standard Library
- Iterators: `begin()`, `end()`, `++`, `--`
- STL algorithms: `sort()`, `find()`, `accumulate()`, and more
- Customizing and extending iterators
- Efficiency and complexity of algorithms

---

### **CPP Module 09: Containers in C++**

This module focuses on understanding and working with different containers in C++. It introduces containers like vectors, lists, sets, maps, and queues, explaining their use cases, benefits, and drawbacks.

**Key Concepts**:
- Sequential containers: `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::list`
- Associative containers: `std::set`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`
- Container adaptors: `std::stack`, `std::queue`, `std::priority_queue`
- Choosing the right container based on performance requirements
- Understanding container-specific operations (insertion, deletion, search)
